A simple but laconic resume template. It is customizable and easy to use. You can use it to build your own resume.

Live Demo:

- <https://paste.tonys-studio.top/>
- <https://lord-turmoil.github.io/MyResume/>

## How to use it

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser to preview the resume. Press `Ctrl + P` to print the resume to a PDF file. You can follow the next section to customize the resume.

> **NOTE:** You may need the VSCode extension [Open In Default Browser](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=peakchen90.open-html-in-browser) to open the HTML file with a HTTP server. Or it cannot correctly load local file.

## Customization

The data of the resume is stored in the `data.json` file. You can modify the data in the file to customize the resume.

You can refer to the template `data.json` to write your own data. You can also extend the template by adding new data types and handlers in `js/index.js`.

```js
const CHAPTER_HANDLERS = {
    "plaintext": _plainTextHandler,
    "timeline": _timelineHandler,
    "multiline": _multilineHandler,
    "project": _projectHandler
};

const SIDEBAR_HANDLERS = {
    "timeline": _sidebarTimelineHandler,
    "list": _sidebarListHandler
};
```

Good luck with your resume! ðŸš€
