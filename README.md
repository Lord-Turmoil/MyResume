## How to use it

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser to preview the resume. Press `Ctrl + P` to print the resume to a PDF file. You can follow the next section to customize the resume.

## Customization

The data of the resume is stored in the `data.json` file. You can modify the data in the file to customize the resume.

You can refer to the template `data.json` to write your own data. You can also extend the template by adding new data types and handlers in `js/index.js`.

```js
const CHAPTER_HANDLERS = {
    "plaintext": _plainTextHandler,
    "timeline": _timelineHandler,
    "multiline": _multilineHandler,
    "project": _projectHandler
};

const SIDEBAR_HANDLERS = {
    "timeline": _sidebarTimelineHandler,
    "list": _sidebarListHandler
};
```

Good luck with your resume! ðŸš€
